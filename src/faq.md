## What does "HHTML" mean?

"HHTML" is the abbreviation for "Hamburg HTML meetup". Also, "HH" is the abbreviation for "Hansestadt Hamburg".

## Where will the meetup take place?

The meetup is location-independent and fully remote. We plan to provide future in-person meetups when it is safe again.

## In what language will the meetup be?

The meetup will be in english.

## Is the meetup only about HTML and nothing else? 

No, we are not a HTML-only meetup. We love to hear what you build with HTML in combination with other technologies. Do you want to share HTML and CSS tricks for accessibility? Want to talk about a JavaScript framework that builds on progressive enhancement? Have tips on improving page load performance? Go for it!

## But I prefer to work with \<framework\> and not with HTML

Use whatever works best for you. Also note that your framework might also render HTML in the end.

If that's the case, you might benefit from knowing about HTML.

## But HTML is not a programming language?

HTML is a programming language. Not up for a debate ðŸ’–.
