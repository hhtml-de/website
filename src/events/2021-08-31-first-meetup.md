This was the very first HHTML meetup and (sadly) officially my last day at SinnerSchrader, back then.

There were a lot of exciting topics: we learned about how [img.ly](https://img) implemented basic accessibility into their canvas-driven application. Also, there was a talk about input types and a talk by Alvarro Montorro about drawing with CSS.
