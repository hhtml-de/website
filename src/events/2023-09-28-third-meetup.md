For the meetup organization, we are currently evaluating [Mobilizon](https://mobilizon.org/en/), which is an open source and federated alternative to [meetup.com](https://meetup.com).

We additionally launched [https://mobilize.hamburg](https://mobilize.hamburg), an instance for Hamburg events. A little meta site with all rules and imprint and stuff is in the works. Our [Code of Conduct](https://hhtml.de/code-of-conduct/) applies.

You don't need an account for signing up to this event. Also, if you have another Mobilizon account on another instance, you can join with that account.
