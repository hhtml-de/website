The third meetup will be the first ever time we will meet in-person. It is going to happen on September 28th, 6pm at Factorial Room F.

Talks scheduled so far:

- Manuel Matuzovic: Web Accessibility and Web Components
- Other talks to be announced.

For the meetup organization, we are currently evaluating [Mobilizon](https://mobilizon.org/en/), which is an open source and federated alternative to [meetup.com](https://meetup.com).

We and launched [https://mobilize.hamburg](https://mobilize.hamburg), an instance for Hamburg events. A little meta site with all rules and imprint and stuff is in the works. Our [Code of Conduct](https://hhtml.de/code-of-conduct/) applies.

You don't need an account for signing up to this event. Also, if you have another Mobilizon account on another instance, you can join with that account.
