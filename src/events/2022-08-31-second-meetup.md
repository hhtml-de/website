There was a meetup in 2022, but apparently I have lost the recordings.

I held a talk about Web Accessibility basics. The slides are at [https://lea11y.de](https://lea11y.de).

Vadim Makheev held a talk about [HTML: The Good parts](https://github.com/hhtml-de/call-for-proposals/issues/3) and the [HTML living spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/). And in particular that you should read it. It saves you writing lots of JavaScript when you know the capabilities of HTML.
