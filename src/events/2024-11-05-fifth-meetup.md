There is going to be a fifth edition of our Hamburg HTML meetup, all about the web platform and accessibility.
_HTML 5_, so to say ðŸ˜….

It's going to be an in-person meetup, scheduled <strong>November 5th, 2024, 6pm at [raumF](https://raum-f.io/) by Factorial.</strong>

## Factorial

Factorial has been our supporter since day 1 ðŸ’–. Be sure to check them out on their [website](https://factorial.io) and their [LinkedIn events page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/factorial-io/events/).

They also have a series of [meetups related to webdev and digital products](https://lea.lgbt/@factorial_io@social.factorial.io/112841361957366272) scheduled. [Lea](https://lea.lgbt/@lea) visited the Frontend & Friends and the Accessibility meetups which both were a blast.

## Rough Agenda

We are planning to have 2 to 3 talk slots. The rough outline of our agenda for now is:

- Doors open will be around 6pm CEST
- 6:30pm Hello Everyone
- 6:45pm Talk Slot 1
- Break
- 7:30pm Talk Slot 2
- More talks?
- Networking
- 10:00pm Closing

## Call for Proposals

We are looking for talks. Our [Call For Proposals](https://hhtml.de/call-for-proposals/) is now officially open.

There will probably be a talk by [Manuel Matuzovic](https://front-end.social/@matuzo). Details are to be discussed and will be announced as soon as we know more.

Manuel will also give away a copy of his new book, the [Accessibility Cookbook](https://accessibility-cookbook.com) in a raffle.

Lea can fully recommend it, a practical hands-on guide to accessibility on the web.
