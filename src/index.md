# Hamburg HTML meetup
<span role="doc-subtitle">putting HTML back into the :focus</span>

Welcome to the Hamburg HTML meetup. HTML is the most underrated programming language. This is why it deserves a meetup :).

We'd like to cover HTML related topics like semantic markup, accessibility, screen readers, SEO, performance and progressive enhancement.

## Upcoming Events

The next event will be on August 31, 2021 7pm CEST.

The meetup will be fully remote and in english, so it's not necessarily limited to Hamburg. The video conference link to the online event will be shared on the day the meetup happens.

RSVP via [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/hhhtml/).

With friendly support from [factorial](https://factorial.io).
