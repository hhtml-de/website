# Hamburg HTML meetup
<span role="doc-subtitle">putting HTML back into the :focus</span>

Welcome to the Hamburg HTML meetup. The meetup stands for putting more love into your markup, as HTML is the most underrated programming language.

Disclaimer: it doesn't stand for bashing other languages. We'd like to discuss HTML related topics like semantic markup, accessibility, screen readers, SEO, performance and progressive enhancement.
